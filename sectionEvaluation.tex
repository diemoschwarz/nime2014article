zero latency!!! better than bonk's one FFT frame of 256 samples = 6~ms added to system latency
(see videos~8.1 and~8.2 on \url{http://imtr.ircam.fr/imtr/CataRT_Instrument})

micro-structure is kept!!!

Sound examples for corpus-based convolution method are on \url{http://demos.concatenative.net/}.
