We propose ways of enriching the timbral potential of gestural sonic material captured via piezo or contact microphones, through latency-free convolution of the microphone signal.
%
This creates a new way to combine the sonic richness of large corpora of sound, easily accessible via navigation through a space of sound descriptors, with the intuitive gestural interaction on a surface by capturing the contact interaction sounds with piezo or contact microphones.
%
We use convolution to excite the grains from a corpus via the microphone input, which allows to articulate them by hitting, scratching, or strumming with various parts of the hands or objects.
%
We show also how changes of grains and interpolation between them have to be specifically handled, and evaluate the system against previous attempts.
