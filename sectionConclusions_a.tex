\section{Conclusions and Future Work}


how to control navigation to have both hands-free to play the mics?


voice controlled: \cite{StowellPlumbley-smc2010-timbre-remapping-regression-tree,Fasciano-si2013b}


proof of concept, many things to be added and optimised


(We could also explore the bass being convolved in line with our previous paper  \cite{TremblaySchwarz-nime2010-surfing-the-waves-short}, Diemo)
